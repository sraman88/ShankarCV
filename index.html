        “Shankar worked with me in my TA team at Browserstack. During his tenure, he was able to achieve a fair degree of success in terms of role closures, process improvements, and stakeholder influencing. Some of his key achievements were hiring senior product leaders, including gender diverse candidates, and improving our post offer engagement process. For his projects and day to day work, I have seen Shankar take a very data driven approach to problem solving. I have enjoyed our discussions and brainstorming sessions and I wish him all the best. Any team would be lucky to have him.”
